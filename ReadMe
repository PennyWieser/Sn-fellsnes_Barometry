This repository contains the code used to perform Cpx-barometry calculations and plotting.

The file Sn√¶fellsnes_FIs_Examples.pdf contains example pictures of FI, and MountMap contains a map of the epoxy puck.  
These are not perfect publication quality figures, but they will allow anyone handling these samples in future to know what FI we analysed,
and look for textural trends.
